        'I currently work at CAEN IT Web Services for Michigan Engineering. As a Student Web Developer, I deal with the creation and maintenance of many departmentsâ€™ web applications using WordPress. A main thing I do is migrate existing sites to a WordPress site, so the site owner is able to maintain and change their existing site on a platform that needs little to none coding experience. This makes managing upwards to 300 different sites for faculty, laboratories, departments, organizations, etc. a much more feasible task. With the end goal of site owners and users being happy and enjoying the final product.',

        'I was given the ability to be a part of the development of a finance app aimed towards college and post-college students that helps with financial health. We carried out beta testing to enhance user experience and user interfaces of the app to produce a product that people would like and prefer. As well as being in my role as a Campus Ambassador, I connected many college students to do the beta testing so the target audience would be able to give insight on what they like and would like to see in the product. I got a glimpse into the techincal side of the product by giving a hand in optimizing the front end design, efficiency, and capabilities of the website that acts as a promotional platform and physical waitlist for the product. With working online we have a discord that is used for communication.',
